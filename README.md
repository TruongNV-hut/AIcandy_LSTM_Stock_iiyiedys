# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

<p align="justify">
This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data. LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that are well-suited for time series forecasting due to their ability to retain long-term dependencies in sequential data. By training on past stock prices, the model learns patterns and trends to make future predictions. The goal of this project is to provide a basic implementation of LSTM for stock price forecasting, showcasing its potential in financial market analysis.
